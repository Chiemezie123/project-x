              The lack of guidance and mentorship is a significant problem
              facing many young people today. Without access to positive role
              models and guidance, many young people struggle to make the right
              choices and navigate the challenges of adulthood. This can lead to
              a range of negative outcomes, including poor academic performance
              , social isolation, substance abuse, and even criminal behavior.
              To address this problem,<strong>Project X</strong> program which
              aims to provide young people with the support and guidance they
              need to reach their full potential.
